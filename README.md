The main goal of this project is providing a tool for people who needs looping over an audio or a section of an audio and, also maybe, slowing or speeding it. As the creator of this app, it was build thinking about dancers, musics, translators.. anyone who may especially need to listen a part of an audio over and over, slowing it down to get it all right.

This project was presented as the final thesis of the Industrial Design Enginering and Product Developement University Degree, at ESEIAAT-UPC (Barcelona, Spain), in 2018. It was valued with a 10 and honors.

\*Currently learning Flutter to release an updated version of this app.
